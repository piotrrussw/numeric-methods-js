# Numeric Methods
Implementation of multiple numeric methods developed during my university class
I use Javascript and Mocha test framework for development.


### Implemented methods

* Lagrange Interpolation
* Dot product
* Legendre Polynomial (recursive)
* Least Squares Approximation
* Newton Divided Difference
* Horner (for natural & newton coefficients)
* Newton coefficients to natural

### Setup

You can simply view this project in your browser by cloning
the repo and:


`npm install`

`npm run build`

and then open index.html
